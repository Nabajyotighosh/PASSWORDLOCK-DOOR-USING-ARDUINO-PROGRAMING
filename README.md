<h1>WELCOME TO NABAJYOTI'S GITHUB PAGE</h1>

>>The aim of this project is to make a password locking security door with alarm system.
  So that the system can give a alarm if anybody is at the door and it can be accessed by user 
  using entering password .The user can change the password also of this system.
  User can run this system in automatic mode also.

 <h1>CIRCUIT DIAGRAM</h1>
 
 >>Circuit diagram is given below . Hc-05 module is not not there.The Rx pin of Hc-05 will be connected to
 arduino Tx pin and Tx pin will be connected to Arduino Rx pin.Remaining circuit is same as diagram given below.

 <h1>FUNCTION PREVIEW</h1>
 
 >>The system work as suppose a person is arrived in front of door then it will give an alarm 
  So that the user can notice then user will input password into app and if the password match the app will
  send signal to arduino then door will open vice versa which is a model made by servo motor in this project.
  A special option is there that automatic mode where user can give the command to door inputing password to open and close 
  simulteneously if there is a person in front of door.It will be checked by ultrasonic sensor.There is a buzzer which give the alarm.
